# fanSlice
This code is for directly computing 2D-slices of normal fans for RNA polytopes. It relies on having a working version of pmfe installed. It can be found here: https://github.com/gtDMMB/pmfe/.

Before running, install sympy (through pip). 

`pip install sympy`

To compute a sequence you can use `runBFS`. Use `-h` to see all the options.
